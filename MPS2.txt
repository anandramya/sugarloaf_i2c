MP29816-C – DUAL LOOP, DIGITAL, 16-PHASE CONTROLLER
PRELIMINARY SPECIFICATIONS SUBJECT TO CHANGE
The MP29816-C supports fault detection either on
CS pin or on PWM pin, to compliant with different
DrMOS fault reporting methodology. It scans the
voltage on CS or PWM pin, when any of the
following faults occurs: VIN UVLO, VIN OVP, OTP,
VOUT UVP, VOUT OVP, OCP, TSENS fault, the
following actions below will be triggered:
1. Shut down the associated rail(s);
2. Start the Intelli-PhaseTM fault type scaning for
related rail(s) by detecting the impedance on
PWM pins if this function is enabled via register
MFR_PRT_CONFIG (CAh page1).
3. Fault types are reported in the register Page 1
DBh, DCh, DDh, DEh, DFh.
4. Faults are recorded into NVM (registers EBh,
ECh, EDh, EEh, EFh in page1), when fault
recording to NVM function is enabled. The last
fault event will be stored. To realize fault storing
into NVM, the VDD33 should be kept for at least
64ms after fault occurs. The flow chart of intelliphase fault detection is shown in Figure 25.
To clear the recorded fault flag in NVM Register,
need send FEh.

PMBUS/I2C COMMUNICATION
General Description
The Power Management Bus (PMBus) is an open
standard power-management protocol that
defines a means of communicating with power
conversion and other devices. It is a two-wire,
bidirectional serial interface, consisting of a data
line (SDA) and a clock line (SCL). The lines are
externally pulled to a bus voltage when they are
“idle”. Connecting to the line, a master device
generates the SCL signal and device address and
arranges the
communication sequence. It is based on the
principles of operation of I2C.The MP29816-C
supports 100KHz, 400KHz and 1MHz bus timing
requirements. Timing and electrical characteristics
of the PMBus can be found in the Electrical
Characteristics section or in the PMB Power
Management Protocol Specification, part1,
revision 1.3, which is available at http://PMBus.org.
PMBus Communication
The MP29816-C supports real-time monitoring for
the VR operation parameters and status with
PMBus interface. Table 4 lists the monitored
parameters.

OPERATION_R1 (01h)
Format: Unsigned binary
The OPERATION_R1 command on page0 is used to turn the rail1 output on or off in conjunction with the
input from EN pin, and set the output voltage to the upper or lower margin voltages. The controller stays
in the OPERATION command setting mode until a subsequent OPERATION command or an EN state
altering change rail1 to another mode.

OPERATION command (as programmed in bits [3:0])
1’b0: VR powers up any time power is present regardless of state of the
CONTROL pin and OPERATION command

CMD_ON_EN_R1

1’b1: To start, the VR requires that the on/off portion of the OPERATION
command is instructing the unit to run.
Depending on bit [2], the VR may also require the CONTROL pin to be asserted
for the VR to start and energize the output.
1’b0: VR ignores the on/off portion of the OPERATION command from serial
bus

PIN_ON_EN_R1

1’b1: VR requires the CONTROL pin to be asserted to start the unit.
Depending on bit [3], the OPERATION command may also be required to
instruct
the device to start before the output is energized.
1’b0: VR ignores the CONTROL pin (on/off controlled only the OPERATION
command).

WRITE_PROTECT (10h)
Format: Unsigned binary
The WRITE_PROTECT command is used to control writing to the PMBus device. The intent of this
command is to provide protection against accidental changes. This command is not intended to provide
protection against deliberate or malicious changes to a device’s configuration or operation. All supports
commands may have their parameters read, regardless of the WRITE_PROTECT settings.

Others: disable write protect.

STORE_USER_ALL (15h)
The STORE_ALL_CODE command instructs the PMBus device to copy the page2 contents, including
internal trim registers of the operating memory to the matching locations in the NVM. In the coping
process, the device calculates CRC codes and saves them in the NVM. The CRC codes are used to
check the data copied from NVM are valid or not at next power up or restoring. This command is written
only. There is no data byte for this command.
RESTORE_USER_ALL (16h)
The RESTORE_ALL_CODE command instructs the PMBus device to copy the page0, page1 and page4
contents including internal trim register from the NVM and over-write the matching locations in the
operating memory. In this process, the device calculates three sets of CRC codes for all restored bits. If
the calculated CRC codes don’t match with the CRC values saved in NVM when storing, the device will
report a CRC error via the bit [4] of register STATUS_CML (7Eh). The CRC error protection action is
enabled by bit [0] of MFR_MTP_MEMORY_CTRL(CCh. page1). After POR, the device will trigger the
memory to copy all operation registers from NVM.
STORE_USER_CODE (17h)
The STORE_ALL_CODE command instructs the PMBus device to copy the page0, page1 and page4
contents, not including internal trim registers. In the coping process, the device calculates CRC codes
and saves them in the NVM. The CRC codes are used to check the data copied from NVM are valid or
not at next power up or restoring. This command is written only. There is no data byte for this command.
RESTORE_USER_CODE (18h)
The RESTORE_ALL_CODE command instructs the PMBus device to copy the page0, page1 and page4
contents, not including internal trim register. In this process, the device calculates three sets of CRC
codes for all restored bits. If the calculated CRC codes don’t match with the CRC values saved in NVM
when storing, the device will report a CRC error via the bit [4] of register STATUS_CML (7Eh). The CRC
error protection action is enabled by bit [0] of MFR_MTP_MEMORY_CTRL(CCh. page1). After POR, the
device will trigger the memory to copy all operation registers from NVM.

The MP29816-C provides positive compensation on VREF at phase shedding
moment so as to reduce the undershoot. The VREF compensation is implanted
by add a PMBus programmable positive voltage on COMP of DC loop. After
phase shedding starts, the voltage will return to 0 step by step with a time
interval, APS_COMP_CNT is used to set this time interval between each step.
50ns/LSB
Set the VREF compensation level at phase shedding to reduce the undershot.
The compensation is added to VREF when phase shedding comes.

STORE_USER_ALL (15h)
The STORE_ALL_CODE command instructs the PMBus device to copy the page2 contents, including
internal trim registers of the operating memory to the matching locations in the NVM. In the coping

RESTORE_USER_ALL (16h)
The RESTORE_ALL_CODE command instructs the PMBus device to copy the page0, page1 and page4
contents including internal trim register from the NVM and over-write the matching locations in the
operating memory. In this process, the device calculates three sets of CRC codes for all restored bits. If
the calculated CRC codes don’t match with the CRC values saved in NVM when storing, the device will
report a CRC error via the bit [4] of register STATUS_CML (7Eh). The CRC error protection action is

PEC_ERROR

PMBus PEC fault indicator.
PMBus interface supports the use of the packet error checking (PEC) byte that
is defined in the SMBus standard. The PEC byte is transmitted by the
MP29816-C during a read transaction or sent to the MP29816-C during a write
transaction. If the PEC byte sent to the controller during a write transaction is
incorrect, the command won’t be executed and PEC_FAULT will be set and
latched. Send CLEAR_FAULTS (03h) to clear the fault.
1’b0: no PEC fault;
1’b1: a PEC fault has been detected.

MTP_CRC_ERROR

CRC fault indicator.
In the process of storing operating memory data into NVM, the MP29816-C
calculates a CRC code for each bit, and save the final CRC code into NVM.
In the process of restore the NVM data to operating memory; the MP29816-C
will re-calculate the CRC code with each bit. The MP29816-C checks the CRC
results when the restore process is done. If the CRC result doesn’t match with
what’s stored at store process, the VR will shut down ant set CRC_FAULT bit.
This bit is in latch mode. Send CLEAR_FAULTS (03h) command to reset the
fault.
1’b0: no NVM CRC fault;
1’b1: an NVM CRC fault has been detected.
